5pm:
	- it's ok that you have those ind vars in params.js 

2pm:
weigh the data e.g. region > fashion? multipliers

try matching exact first? or filtering it down
	- so you'll have some manual matching e.g. "Weed"

for multiple e.g. "weed, acid"; combine them to give higher value or just default to first?
	- think number sense; which will give you better rep






- do't stub


- parse both by # exact matches and "distance"
