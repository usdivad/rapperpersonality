2pm:
weigh the data e.g. region > fashion? multipliers

try matching exact first? or filtering it down
	- so you'll have some manual matching e.g. "Weed"

for multiple e.g. "weed, acid"; combine them to give higher value or just default to first?
	- think number sense; which will give you better rep

- do't stub
- parse both by # exact matches and "distance"
