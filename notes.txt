- back:
	- weighing: sound=*3, region=*2
	- combining the two algorithms
		- e.g. go by # matches, but do a check on proximity to make sure it's not too high
	- ***implement the multiple checkboxes etc.!!
		- year
		- sound
		- drug
		- liquor

		- have options see how many picked match. 
			- use score for the checkbox ones? and just match for the other
			- (obv there's no single objective measure; just like prediction)
	- input questions
- front:
	- boot
	- wordpress integration

	- prototype based prgm

2pm:
weigh the data e.g. region > fashion? multipliers

try matching exact first? or filtering it down
	- so you'll have some manual matching e.g. "Weed"

for multiple e.g. "weed, acid"; combine them to give higher value or just default to first?
	- think number sense; which will give you better rep

- do't stub
- parse both by # exact matches and "distance"
